            <p>My personal finance journey was one defined by ups and downs. It wasn't until I was adopted by my mom that I was able to begin making my millions. I owe my mom everything. Mainly because she married my rich step-dad, and he's the one who has bankrolled all my business ventures. Thanks for marrying rich, mom!</p>
