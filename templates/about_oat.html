                Oatie "Oat" Kaplow was born July 5, 2023 in Eugene, Oregon. She had a tumultuous upbringing until her step-father, Abie Safdie, came into her life. From then on, it's been sunshine and rainbows. So much so that Oat has been defined as perfection in living form. Everyone around the world yearns to just grab a glimpse of the famous Oat.

                And many, many more! Oatie's hobbies and occupations are boundless and only time will tell if anything is not within her reach.

            <p>
                Oatie's mom, Sasha Kaplow, is a star in her own right, but many credit Oat's meteoric rise to her step-father, Abie Safdie. At their shared time at the U of O, they developed an inseparable bond that will last a lifetime. There are rumors that there is a custody battle taking place currently, as Abie is seeking full custody of Oat so she can continue to reach her full potential. But that will be left to the jury...
            </p>
            <p>
            	Ultimately, Oat loves her new life in Southern California and can't wait to keep showing the world what she accomplishes!
